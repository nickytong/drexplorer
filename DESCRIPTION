Description: There is a great variety of models developed for dose-response
    data, many of which have been implemented in the drc and DoseFinding
    packages. drexplorer combines both packages to aid the user to visually
    examine and compare how existing models perform on the data. Another
    important feature for drexplorer is to allow the user to identify outlier
    measurements and visually examine how these outliers affect the fitted
    model.
